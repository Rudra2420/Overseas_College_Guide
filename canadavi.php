			Canada continues to attract a steady volume of students from India. While getting admission to Top Universities in Canada continues to require excellent academic score, the permission to study is validated by means of a Study Permit. If you wish to take academic, professional, or vocational training at a university, college, or any other educational institution in Canada, you will need a study permit before you enter Canada. This study permit is issued to students when they arrive in Canada. However, to get there, a student must first apply for a Temporary Resident Visa which is provided by the Canadian High Commission and facilitated by the Visa Application Centers. VFS Global Services is the designated VACs for Canadian Visa. 
		</p>
		<H2>Eligibility criteria for Canada Student Visa</H2>
		<p>You can apply for a Canada Study visa if you fulfill the following criteria:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><p >You have been accepted by a designated learning institute (DLI).</p></li>
		  <li><p>You need to prove that you have adequate funds to pay your tuition fee and living expenses.</p></li>
		  <li><p>You need to prove that you have a clean background and no criminal record. The aspirants need to produce a police certificate to prove this.</p></li>
		  <li><p>You need to do a health checkup and produce a medical certificate that certifies that you are in good health.</p></li>

		<h2>Which Documents are required for Canadian Visa?</h2>
		<p>You should apply for the student visa after you get the college acceptance letter. You should begin with the visa process around June if aiming at the September intake. The following are the documents needed to apply For Canada Student Visa.</p>
		<h3>1. Valid Passport:</h3>
		<p>You would need a Valid Passport to be able to apply for a Study Permit. As of the Canadian High Commission, it is important that you have a passport whose validity covers the intended stay in Canada. For instance, if you plan to travel to Canada in September 2019 for a two-year course, your passport should be valid until at least September 2021.</p>
		<h3>2. Proof of Acceptance by a Designated Learning Institution:</h3>
		<p>You would need the acceptance letter from the university/institute you are planning to attend. A Designated Learning Institute is the University which is recognized by the Immigration Department. (Hereâ€™s a list for your reference). In case you are applying for Quebec, you would also need a CAQ which you would be duly notified.</p>

		<p>At the time of application for your Study Permit, you would have to show proof of funds. As per the present standards, you would have to prove that you would have enough funds to pay our tuition fees as well as take care of living expenses.

		<p><b>Note:</b></p>
