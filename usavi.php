The visa you need will depend on your age and the type of study you wish to pursue in the US. Here’s an overview of the types of study visas and their application requirements:
		</p><br>

		<h2>F-1 Student visa</h2>
       <img src="assets/img/f1visa.jpg">
       
       <p>An F1 Visa is a non-immigrant visa issued to students willing to pursue their studies in the US. The F1 visa is a student visa which is given to international students who wish to attend educational institutions like university, college, private elementary school, high school, any language training program or any other academic institution in the US. If the candidate has received acceptance from any of the above institutes then he/she can apply for the F1 Visa.</p>
	</div><br>

	<p>Most students who wish to pursue their studies overseas opt for the F-1 Student Visa. There are three major steps to its procedure, being:</p>
	<table>
      
	<tr>
            <td>Step 1</td>
            <td>SEVIS fee and I-20 form collection</td>
            <td>Pay your visa fee at the designated bank and collect the visa form. Duly fill the form and bring along for your interview.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
            <td>Step 2</td>
            <td>VISA fee and form collection</td>
            <td>Once you pay the SEVIS fee, you are given an I-20 form from your new school or college. Duly fill the form and bring along for your F-1 interview.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
            <td>Step 3</td>
            <td>VISA interview</td>
            <td>Schedule a visa interview with the US embassy in your country. The waiting time may vary depending on the visa type. Once you complete the interview successfully, you’ll receive your visa 120 days in advance.</td>
    </tr>

	<h5>P.S: You can move to the US only 30 days before the start date of your program.</h5><br>

	<h2>J1 Exchange Visitor Visa</h2>
	<ul>
		 <li>The J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa is for students, visiting scholars or lecturers pursuing an exchange program. For example, Fulbright scholars and many students on short-term study abroad programs from Indian universities will travel to the U.S. on a J-1 visa.</li>
		 <li>J1 visa is usually sought by a working professional who goes to America on an exchange program, hence the name Exchange Visitor Visa. These may include a 10-month vocational training or some research fellowship, etc. Whichever be the case, the applicants would be notified for the same by the respective institutions. </li>
		 <li>Spouses or children accompanying J-1 Visa recipients will travel on a J-2 Visa. Please note that spouses are able to work when permission is obtained in advance.</li>
	 </ul>

	 <h3>Here are some of the main categories of the J1 visa -</h3>
	 <ul>
		 <li>Short-Term Scholar - Every year, research scholars teach along with conducting research at US universities for up to six months.</li>
		 <li> Au Pair - Individuals between the ages of 18 - 26 years can come to the US to study and live with a sponsor family for up to two years. They can study at a US university, along with providing childcare to the sponsor family.</li>
		 <li>Internship – Recent graduates can come to the US to learn about the American culture and get hands-on experience in their chosen profession.</li>
		 <li>Work and Travel – Full-time students enrolled at a post-secondary school can come to the US to work and travel during the winter, spring and summer season-breaks.</li>
		 <li>Camp Counselor – Individuals who are 18 years or older can come to the US and work with local youth at the US summer camps as a camp teacher.</li>
		 <li>International Visitor Program - the US Department of State selects international visitors to consult, research, observe, and train with the US colleges</li>
	 </ul>

	 <h3>Studying in the US</h3>
	 <p>Many J1 holders who are in the US universities are typically research scholars or visiting professors. Other J1 programs also offer educational opportunities, such as Au Pairs. Though it is important to check with your sponsor family to determine the visa you will be applying to.</p>

	 <h3>Working in the US</h3>
	 <p>The number of hours you are allowed to work depend on the program you apply for. So it is important to research beforehand and know the requirements. Some J1 visas have a two-year residence requirement, which means you would be required to remain in India for two years after finishing your J1 program.</p>

	 <h3>How to Apply</h3>
	 <p>The application process to J1 visa is similar to that of the tourist visa (B1). Below are the steps you need to follow to apply for the J1 visa -</p>
	 <ol>
	 	<li>Complete and submit the Nonimmigrant Visa Electronic Application (DS-160) form</li>
	 	<li>Pay the visa fee ($160)</li>
	 	<li>Schedule your visa appointment and Bio-metric appointment</li>
	 	<li>For your visa application center appointment you will need to bring along your passport, DS-160 confirmation page, your appointment confirmation page.</li>
	 	<li>Visit the U.S. Embassy or Consulate on the date of your visa interview</li><br>


	 <h2>M-1 Vocational/ Non-Academic Student Visa</h2>
	 	<ul>
	 		<li>The M1 visa is a type of student visa which is reserved for vocational and technical schools. While the process for applying to the F1 visa and M-1 is similar, the difference is that on entering, the M1 visas are time-stamped and students cannot overstay their visit.</li>
	 	</ul>
