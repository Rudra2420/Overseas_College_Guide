	       The F1 Visa is a US student visa (non-immigrant) required by international students who wish to study in the US. However, if you enter the USA through this visa, you are required to complete the whole duration of the course. Only the US Embassies and USA consulates outside the US have the authority to issue F-1 Visas. No other governing body or agencies can issue F-1 visas. However, for extensions in stay or changes in the status of the applicant can be done within the US through legitimate agencies. Further, the spouse and/or children of the F-1 Visa candidates need to get the dependent’s F-2 Visa. The F-2 Visa holders are not permitted to join any form of employment although the children are allowed to attend public schools.</p><br>
       
         <h2>F-1 Visa Document requirements</h2>
	
         <p>Before we share the list of documents required for the F-1 Visa interview, we would like to reiterate that you would not be asked for any documents other than your application/ appointment letter. However, being prepared is always advisable and you should keep these documents handy for that one in a million chance of the interviewer asking to see any document.</p>

         <p>Also, file them neatly so that they are easily accessible. In addition, your original passport should be readily available, as you would be requested to submit the same.</p><br>
